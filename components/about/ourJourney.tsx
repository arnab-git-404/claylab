            Every child deserves joyful, quality education â€” one that&apos;s just a few clicks away.
            <br />
            We dream of classrooms without borders, where students explore their interests,
            lead passion projects, and grow as changemakers.

            CLAY stands for Centre for Learning, Affection, and joy.
            <br />
            We believe learning should uplift, not overwhelm.
            <br />
            With mentorship rooted in love and purpose, we help students bloom, shine, and fly.

            Born during the lockdown in April 2020, Claylab began with 3 teachers and a few students.
            <br />
            By July, it became a registered not-for-profit.
            <br />
            Today, it&apos;s a growing community of mentors and learners rewriting what education can be.
