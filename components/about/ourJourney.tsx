            With a mission to handhold their students till they get decent employment, 
            Claylab focussed on holistic education of students. 
            As it all happened in the middle of the pandemic, most of our programs were 
            started as online spaces and with the time, we narrowed  down on 2 flagship 
            initiatives â€” the <span className="font-bold">Mentorship Program</span> and the <span className="font-bold">School of Entrepreneurship</span>. 
            Together, these have supported thousands of students to build social capital, 
            leadership skills, and entrepreneurial mindsets.
          </p>

            Today, Claylab is moving closer to its larger dream: 
            <span className="font-bold"> transforming entire schools into spaces of future-readiness.</span>
